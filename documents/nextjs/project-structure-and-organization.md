# Project structure and organization
@doc-version: 16.0.1


This page provides an overview of **all** the folder and file conventions in Next.js, and recommendations for organizing your project.

## Folder and file conventions

### Top-level folders

Top-level folders are used to organize your application's code and static assets.

![Route segments to path segments](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/top-level-folders.png)

|                                                                    |                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |

| [`pages`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing.md)           | Pages Router                       |
| [`public`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder.md) | Static assets to be served         |
| [`src`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder.md)       | Optional application source folder |

### Top-level files

Top-level files are used to configure your application, manage dependencies, run proxy, integrate monitoring tools, and define environment variables.

|                                                                              |                                         |

### Routing Files

Add `page` to expose a route, `layout` for shared UI such as header, nav, or footer, `loading` for skeletons, `error` for error boundaries, and `route` for APIs.

|                                                                               |                     |                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [`layout`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout.md)                   | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Layout                       |
| [`page`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page.md)                       | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Page                         |
| [`loading`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading.md)                 | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Loading UI                   |
| [`not-found`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found.md)             | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Not found UI                 |
| [`error`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error.md)                     | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Error UI                     |

| [`template`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/template.md)               | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Re-rendered layout           |
| [`default`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default.md)                 | `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Parallel route fallback page |

### Nested routes

Folders define URL segments. Nesting folders nests segments. Layouts at any level wrap their child segments. A route becomes public when a `page` or `route` file exists.

| Path                        | URL pattern     | Notes                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `app/layout.tsx`            | —               | Root layout wraps all routes  |
| `app/blog/layout.tsx`       | —               | Wraps `/blog` and descendants |
| `app/page.tsx`              | `/`             | Public route                  |
| `app/blog/page.tsx`         | `/blog`         | Public route                  |
| `app/blog/authors/page.tsx` | `/blog/authors` | Public route                  |

### Dynamic routes

Parameterize segments with square brackets. Use `[segment]` for a single param, `[...segment]` for catch‑all, and `[[...segment]]` for optional catch‑all. Access values via the [`params`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page.md#params-optional) prop.

| Path                            | URL pattern                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`      | `/blog/my-first-post`                                                |
| `app/shop/[...slug]/page.tsx`   | `/shop/clothing`, `/shop/clothing/shirts`                            |
| `app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` | `/docs`, `/docs/layouts-and-pages`, `/docs/api-reference/use-router` |

### Route groups and private folders

Organize code without changing URLs with route groups [`(group)`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-groups.md#convention), and colocate non-routable files with private folders [`_folder`](#private-folders).

| Path                            | URL pattern | Notes                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `app/(marketing)/page.tsx`      | `/`         | Group omitted from URL                    |
| `app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx`      | `/cart`     | Share layouts within `(shop)`             |
| `app/blog/_components/Post.tsx` | —           | Not routable; safe place for UI utilities |
| `app/blog/_lib/data.ts`         | —           | Not routable; safe place for utils        |

### Parallel and Intercepted Routes

These features fit specific UI patterns, such as slot-based layouts or modal routing.

Use `@slot` for named slots rendered by a parent layout. Use intercept patterns to render another route inside the current layout without changing the URL, for example, to show a details view as a modal over a list.

| Pattern (docs)                                                                              | Meaning              | Typical use case                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [`@folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes.md#slots)                 | Named slot           | Sidebar + main content                   |
| [`(.)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes.md#convention)      | Intercept same level | Preview sibling route in a modal         |
| [`(..)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes.md#convention)     | Intercept parent     | Open a child of the parent as an overlay |
| [`(..)(..)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes.md#convention) | Intercept two levels | Deeply nested overlay                    |
| [`(...)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes.md#convention)    | Intercept from root  | Show arbitrary route in current view     |

## Organizing your project

Next.js is **unopinionated** about how you organize and colocate your project files. But it does provide several features to help you organize your project.

### Component hierarchy

The components defined in special files are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

* `layout.js`
* `template.js`
* `error.js` (React error boundary)
* `loading.js` (React suspense boundary)
* `not-found.js` (React error boundary for "not found" UI)
* `page.js` or nested `layout.js`

![Component Hierarchy for File Conventions](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png)

The components are rendered recursively in nested routes, meaning the components of a route segment will be nested **inside** the components of its parent segment.

![Nested File Conventions Component Hierarchy](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/nested-file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png)

### Colocation

In the `app` directory, nested folders define route structure. Each folder represents a route segment that is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.

However, even though route structure is defined through folders, a route is **not publicly accessible** until a `page.js` or `route.js` file is added to a route segment.

![A diagram showing how a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-not-routable.png)

And, even when a route is made publicly accessible, only the **content returned** by `page.js` or `route.js` is sent to the client.

![A diagram showing how page.js and route.js files make routes publicly accessible.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-routable.png)

This means that **project files** can be **safely colocated** inside route segments in the `app` directory without accidentally being routable.

![A diagram showing colocated project files are not routable even when a segment contains a page.js or route.js file.](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-colocation.png)

> **Good to know**: While you **can** colocate your project files in `app` you don't **have** to. If you prefer, you can [keep them outside the `app` directory](#store-project-files-outside-of-app).

### Private folders

Private folders can be created by prefixing a folder with an underscore: `_folderName`

This indicates the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system, thereby **opting the folder and all its subfolders** out of routing.

![An example folder structure using private folders](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-private-folders.png)

Since files in the `app` directory can be [safely colocated by default](#colocation), private folders are not required for colocation. However, they can be useful for:

* Separating UI logic from routing logic.
* Consistently organizing internal files across a project and the Next.js ecosystem.
* Sorting and grouping files in code editors.
* Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.

> **Good to know**:
>
> * While not a framework convention, you might also consider marking files outside private folders as "private" using the same underscore pattern.
> * You can create URL segments that start with an underscore by prefixing the folder name with `%5F` (the URL-encoded form of an underscore): `%5FfolderName`.
> * If you don't use private folders, it would be helpful to know Next.js [special file conventions](/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure.md#routing-files) to prevent unexpected naming conflicts.

### Route groups

Route groups can be created by wrapping a folder in parenthesis: `(folderName)`

This indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should **not be included** in the route's URL path.

![An example folder structure using route groups](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-route-groups.png)

Route groups are useful for:

* Organizing routes by site section, intent, or team. e.g. marketing pages, admin pages, etc.
* Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
  * [Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts](#creating-multiple-root-layouts)
  * [Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment](#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)

### `src` folder

Next.js supports storing application code (including `app`) inside an optional [`src` folder](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder.md). This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.

![An example folder structure with the src folder](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-src-directory.png)

## Examples

The following section lists a very high-level overview of common strategies. The simplest takeaway is to choose a strategy that works for you and your team and be consistent across the project.

> **Good to know**: In our examples below, we're using `components` and `lib` folders as generalized placeholders, their naming has no special framework significance and your projects might use other folders like `ui`, `utils`, `hooks`, `styles`, etc.

### Store project files outside of `app`

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of your project** and keeps the `app` directory purely for routing purposes.

![An example folder structure with project files outside of app](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-project-root.png)

### Store project files in top-level folders inside of `app`

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of the `app` directory**.

![An example folder structure with project files inside app](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-app-root.png)

### Split project files by feature or route

This strategy stores globally shared application code in the root `app` directory and **splits** more specific application code into the route segments that use them.

![An example folder structure with project files split by feature or route](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/project-organization-app-root-split.png)

### Organize routes without affecting the URL path

To organize routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. `(marketing)` or `(shop)`).

![Organizing Routes with Route Groups](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-organisation.png)

Even though routes inside `(marketing)` and `(shop)` share the same URL hierarchy, you can create a different layout for each group by adding a `layout.js` file inside their folders.

![Route Groups with Multiple Layouts](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-multiple-layouts.png)

### Opting specific segments into a layout

To opt specific routes into a layout, create a new route group (e.g. `(shop)`) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. `account` and `cart`). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. `checkout`).

![Route Groups with Opt-in Layouts](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-opt-in-layouts.png)

### Opting for loading skeletons on a specific route

To apply a [loading skeleton](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading.md) via a `loading.js` file to a specific route, create a new route group (e.g., `/(overview)`) and then move your `loading.tsx` inside that route group.

![Folder structure showing a loading.tsx and a page.tsx inside the route group](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-loading.png)

Now, the `loading.tsx` file will only apply to your dashboard → overview page instead of all your dashboard pages without affecting the URL path structure.

### Creating multiple root layouts

To create multiple [root layouts](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout.md#root-layout), remove the top-level `layout.js` file, and add a `layout.js` file inside each route group. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The `<html>` and `<body>` tags need to be added to each root layout.

![Route Groups with Multiple Root Layouts](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/route-group-multiple-root-layouts.png)

In the example above, both `(marketing)` and `(shop)` have their own root layout.
